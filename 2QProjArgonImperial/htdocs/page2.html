				<b>Biology and History</b> <br>
				Dogs are terrestrial, quadrupedal creatures, they evolved from wolves into our loyal pets today. To become our modern day dogs, wolves went through domestication
				and artificial selection. Because of their predatory roots dogs have claws and pointed canine teeth to both kill their prey and to mechanically break down meat they also
				evolved to be more connected to their pack(a group of wolves or dogs). Because of them being terrestrial as opposed to fish they developed organs/parts that are more suited
				to land, while they can swim their limbs are more suited to land, they developed closed circulatory systems and lungs like our own. There is only one species of
				domesticated dogs, <i>Canis familiaris</i>however there are many different breeds

				As seen on the video to the right, dogs have many different breeds and talents. Most of them are kept as pets but some of them have talents in other work.
				Some dogs are bred for hunting, dogs like retrievers and terriers hunt rodents and assist in hunting while other dogs are bred for guarding and herding, dogs like collies
				and sheperds and others just for show, pugs and the like.
