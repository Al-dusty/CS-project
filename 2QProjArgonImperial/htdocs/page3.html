				<b>Biology and History</b> <br>
				Cats are much like dogs, terrestrial and quadrupedal creatures, they however evolved from wild cats. Much like the wolves wild cats went through domestication
				and artificial selection to  become the modern-day domesticated cats. They also developed claws and sharp canine teeth to kill prey and mechanically break down meat 
				. Because of them being terrestrial they developed organs/parts that are more suited to land, their limbs are more suited to land organs, they developed closed circulatory systems
				and lungs like our own. There is only one species of domesticated cats, <i>Felis catus</i> however there are a few different breeds
			</p>

				Because of their predatory behavior they sometimes kill rodents but they are usually kept as companions, feral ones usually form packs or feral gangs.
